Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis is a critical step in the data science process that involves summarising and visualising the main characteristics of a dataset. The primary goal of EDA is to understand the data, uncover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions through statistical graphics and other data visualisation techniques.

1.1.1 Key Steps in EDA:

Data Collection: Gathering relevant data from various sources.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting errors, and ensuring data quality.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculating mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and other statistical measures to summarise the data.
Data Visualisation: Creating plots like histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to visualise relationships and distributions.
Data Transformation: Normalising or scaling data, and creating new variables (features) from existing ones.

1.1.2 Tools for EDA:

Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
R Libraries: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr.

1.1.3 Benefits of EDA:

Identifies underlying patterns and relationships.
Helps in the detection of outliers and anomalies.
Provides a foundation for further data analysis and model building.
